In my [previous article]({{ '/posts/on-prioritizing-side-projects/' | url }}) I mentioned my struggle to manage and complete my side projects. While I have gotten better at time management and organization, I still struggle to keep my momentum. 

In hopes of getting better at being accountable, I’m trying to limit my goals to a one-week time frame. I set up a small list of no more than three or four goals to complete by the end of the week. These goals have to be doable within that time frame. By the end of each week, I will reflect on these goals and evaluate my progress. 

To be more disciplined, I’ve started to tweet my goals with a [#myWeeklyGoals](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23myWeeklyGoals%20&src=typd) hashtag. I feel like announcing my goals publicly will put more pressure on me to actually do  them. By the end of the week, I plan to tweet about my progress on each goal. 

Here is why I’m really interested in trying this weekly goals method:


- **Forces me to break down my goals into smaller tasks with limited scope:** I have a huge list of broad project ideas that I never attempted to tackle because I am intimidated by their large scope. Having tasks broken into smaller actionable ones makes them more approachable.
- **Enables me to have better life balance:** For example, I sometimes feel guilty for having fun because there is this pressing feeling that I should be doing something productive. Having weekly goals means I can have a better reward system in my life. Once I can feel confident that I will complete my goals within a week, I can reward myself and have carefree fun. 
- **Disciplines me to stay on track**: There are tasks which are no fun to do but required (called being an adult) such as calling the insurance company, laundry, meal prep, etc. Weekly goals along with a reward system help me get better at those kinds of tasks. 
- **Helps me to be more focused:** Having set goals for the week prevents me from being tempted to switch to other tasks or projects. 

Finally, I also want to clarify that goals can be literally anything you want and not limited to professional ones. Here is an example of some goals I might set for myself in the future: 


- Finishing a certain number of chapters of a book I’m reading.
- Going to the gym 5 times a week.
- Finishing up a tutorial to learn a particular tech.
- Building one or two small core features of a side project.
- Cooking my own meals at least 3 times within a week.
- Finishing a blog post… done!

Join me in this initiative… share your goals on twitter [#myWeeklyGoals](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23myWeeklyGoals%20&src=typd) and post updates regularly. Let’s try it together! :)
