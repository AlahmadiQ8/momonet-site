I want to be a better writer for two reasons.

The first one is somewhat obvious; writing is a useful skill in every facet of my life.

Good writing skills enable you to communicate well. Being able to communicate well makes clarifying my ideas, working with others, and understanding my thoughts much easier.

For example, I've changed, grew, and was inspired through reading the work of others. In the same way, I want to acquire good writing skills to make a change in others through writing as well.

Due to the nature of my work, I rarely practice writing. Anytime I do a task requiring writing at work (emails, documentation, etc.), I realize my shortcomings as a writer. These realizations prompt me to think about my weak writing skills, and it may make my ability to communicate more challenging.

My second reason, for wanting to be a better writer, is clarity of thought. The ability to communicate my thoughts in writing is a great way to clarify those thoughts. I firmly believe that it also inspires more ideas.

In the end, the only way that I will be a better writer is to keep practicing. On this website, I write regularly on random topics in my life. This space will serve as a public writing journal not just for me to reflect on years from now, but also to connect with and hopefully inspire others.
