Inspired by [this awesome post](https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/newsletter/2019-01-04-goodbye-2018-hello-2019-and-of-wizards-who-use-vim/), I want to take this time to reflect on my life goals and what I hope to accomplish by the end of the year. 

2018 was a wonderful year where I have been able to grow a lot personally and professionally. I was in Santa Barbara for my last gig. During my time I have made lifelong friendships, explored various hobbies, and even tried new things outside of my comfort zone. 

I want to take this space to jot down my goals for this year. I have a few big projects that will push my boundaries this year in hopes to help me grow as a person. 

## Create a niche website that delivers value

I have entrepreneurial dreams and as a practice and first steps, I want to build a niche website. I expect fully to make tons of mistakes but that is how I’ll learn and grow. This will be the biggest projects this year. Through this project, I hope to learn the following:


- Learn more about product management
- Make me a better web developer
- Learn to delegate responsibilities and not do everything myself
- Solves a real-world problem

## Complete reading my booklist

I want to develop the habit of reading books more rather than scrolling through my blog feeds. This is a really tough one because nonfiction can be very dry and boring. Blogs, on the other hand, are intentionally click-baity, appeals to our emotion, and take less mental energy. But they can easily be a [form of procrastination](https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/newsletter/2019-01-25-typescript-explosion-procrastination-and-wizards-use-vim/#reading-blogs-as-a-form-of-procrastination). It's also hard to ingrain the information in my head. Reading books, on the other hand, has a much better return for my time and information stick much longer. 

Here are the list of books I aim to finish this year

- The Effective Engineer
- The 4 hour workweek
- The E-Myth Revisited
- The Lean Startup
- Becoming - Michelle Obama (Audiobook)

Besides the obvious benefits of reading, I hope to achieve the following goals: 

- Learn more about entrepreneurship
- Get better at removing distractions. Unlike reading articles, books require a longer attention span. That means I’d have to kill all unnecessary distractions like the following: 
  - Being away from my phone
  - Social media: Yes I have a social media addiction problem. I am currently adopting a less aggressive version of [this guy](https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/blog/2018/10/05/how-to-be-more-productive-and-have-a-happier-life-in-5-easy-steps) by setting timers on my social media phone apps. 

## Travel more

After my recent trip to Barcelona with my family, I realized how much I missed out on traveling. My trip expanded my horizon beyond the Southern California bubble. This year, my goal is to save money for traveling. 

## Replace solo activities with social experiences

By solo activities I mean Netflix and video games. I want to replace those with more lasting memory activities like hanging out with family and friends. This would strengthens my bond with my beloved ones. After all, I am an emotional human being and selfishly in need of a support system.
