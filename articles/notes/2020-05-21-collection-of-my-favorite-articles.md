### [[Video] How to Talk to Users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4Ig2uqjTc)

Major takeaways:

  * Talk about their life, not your idea
  * Talk specifics, not hypotheticals
  * Listen, don't talk

Five important questions to ask:

1. What's the hardest part about [doing this thing]?
2. Tell me about the last time you encountered that problem…
3. Why was that hard?
4. What, if anything, have you done to try to solve the problem?
5. What don't you love about the solutions you've tried?

Talking to users is useful at all stages

* Got idea? -> Find users with problem
* Built prototype -> Best first customer
* Launched -> find product market fit
