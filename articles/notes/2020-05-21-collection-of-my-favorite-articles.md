### [[Video] How to Get Startup Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvw-u99yj8w)

* Mistakes people make:
  * Believing you need an amazing idea. When google started, it was the 20th search engine. But it was good enough, with great execution.
  * Jumping into an idea without evaluating if it's a good idea.
  * Starting with a solution instead of a problem
* Think of an idea as a starting point. AirBnb was a site for renting beds.
* How to Evaluate Startup Ideas
  * How big is this idea? How big could it be?
  * Founder / Market Fit
  * How sure are you that this is solving an acute problem?
  * Have a new insight?
* Bad Reasons to reject startup ideas
  * Hard to get started
  * Boring space
  * Seems too ambitious
  * Too many competitors
* Recipes to generating startup ideas (from best to worst)
  1. Start with what your team is especially good at
     1. Go through every job you've had
     2. What are unique skills you learned?
     3. What seemed broken?
     4. What did you develop in-house?
  2. Think of things you wish someone would build for you
  3. What would you be excited to work on for 10 years? Be careful though
  4. Look for things that have changed in the world recently
  5. Find companies that have been successfully recently and look for variance of them
  6. Ask people you know for problems they want solved
  7. Look for industries that seem broken


### [[Video] How to Talk to Users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4Ig2uqjTc)

Major takeaways:

  * Talk about their life, not your idea
  * Talk specifics, not hypotheticals
  * Listen, don't talk

Five important questions to ask:

1. What's the hardest part about [doing this thing]?
2. Tell me about the last time you encountered that problem…
3. Why was that hard?
4. What, if anything, have you done to try to solve the problem?
5. What don't you love about the solutions you've tried?

Talking to users is useful at all stages

* Got idea? -> Find users with problem
* Built prototype -> Best first customer
* Launched -> find product market fit
