# About Me

My name is Mohammad. I’m a programmer who loves solving problems with code. I’m also a passionate learner, and I enjoy sharing what I’ve learned along the way with other programmers to help them on their journey.

My goal is to become an entrepreneur and to create a SaaS company eventually. I realized this was what I wanted to do when I built a feature for a Microsoft product to solve my own problem, and found out that many other people benefited from having it solved too – to the point where I received an influx of $5 donations from strangers on the internet. I was thrilled, not because I made money, but because it validated that what I'd done had helped others.

I started my journey as an engineer at a small startup called ElephantDrive, where I learned a lot about startup life. In addition to developing features in JavaScript and .NET, I also worked closely with end users to discover their pain points and get their feedback. I went on to join Procore Technologies, a company that’s now gone public, where I worked web applications using React and Rails alongside a talented team.

After two years of honing my skills at Procore, I moved to NYC to work for Capital One on their next-generation Risk Analyst application, shifting from the frontend to building backend microservices in .NET. In this role, I had the opportunity to work on a greenfield project and developing it from the ground up with early customers. That reminded me of my entrepreneurship aspirations. It was such a rewarding experience seeing the project come to life from pre-production.

Finally, I joined Microsoft, where I work on Azure Cost Management APIs. Working on large-scale distributed services with ten thousand requests per minute, I’ve gained valuable insight into building and monitoring highly reliable systems.
On this site, I'll be documenting my journey toward building a SaaS company, as well as writing about things I learn on software development.
